**1. What does the ___word___ 'polymorphism' mean?**

Polymorphism is the principle by which an object can take on multiple forms or properties. 

**2. What does it mean when we apply polymorphism to OO design? Give a simple Java example.**

In OO design, polymorphism means the object can be considered as its Class, Parent Class or any Interfaces that it takes on. An example of OO polymorphism would be a car taking on the properties and methods of its class Car, as well as any inherited methods of its Parent Class Vehicle and an interface of IDrive.

**3. What can we use to implement polymorphism in Java?**

Classes & Interfaces

**4. How many 'forms' can an object take when using polymorphism?**
Many

**5. Give an example of when you could use polymorphism?**
Polymorphism is useful in strongly typed languages where only one Type of object can be returned. Therefore using an interface or Parent class to group multiple options together allows more flexibility in method outputs and iterables such as such as ArrayLists & Hashmaps. 


# Composition and Aggregation

**6. What do we mean by 'composition' in reference to object-oriented programming?**
Composition refers to the making up of an object from other components or objects. These components parts don't make sense as stand-alone objects, but directly support the behaviours of the overall main object.

**7. When would you use composition? Provide a simple example in Java.**
Composition in Java could look like building a chair out of a Base and Legs. Individually the base & legs do not make sense, but combined they make a chair and may offer methods such as sit() or balance().

**8. Give a difference between composition and aggregation?**
Aggregation is the bringing together of objects that are loosely related, but can also operate independently of eachother (ie a collection of rollercoasters to make a Theme Park), where as the components used in composition are tightly linked and rely on being part of a bigger main object to operate and make sense. 

**9. What is/are the advantage(s) of using composition/aggregation?**

**10. When using composition, when an object is destroyed, what happens to all the objects it is composed of?**

**11. When using aggregation, when an object is destroyed, what happens to all the objects it is composed of?**
